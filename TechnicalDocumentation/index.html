      <p>This technical documentation represents the organization of the first semester of a First-Year or Introductory Algebra class. It is not really a technical document, but it will help me organize another project while completing this free code camp requirement.</p>

      <p>Working with Real Numbers</p>
      <p>Review of the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integers, decimals, and fractions. This unit also reviews the basic properties of these operations. There is a basic introduction to the set of real numbers and its subsets, numerical and algebraic expressions, powers and exponents, percents, and absolute value. The unit wraps up with a review of order of operations</p>

      <p>Algebraic Expressions</p>
      <p>This unit introduces the use of letters or symbols to represent numbers, allowing us to create short algebraic expressions to replace longer verbal statements. First, we practice adding and subtracting like terms, also known as combining like terms, to simplify algebraic expressions. Next, we use the distributive property to expand algebraic expressions. This is followed by factoring algebraic expressions, reversing the expansion we did previously. Then we practice evaluating algebraic expressions for given values of the variables. Finally, we practice writing algebraic expressions, going from English to math.</p>

      <p>Solving Equations with a Single Variable</p>
      <p>In this unit, we will practice solving equations containing a single variable. It will have five sub-units:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Solving equations in one step with addition or subtraction</li>
        <li>Solving equations in one step with multiplication or division</li>
        <li>Solving equations with two-step</li>
        <li>Solving equations with multiple steps</li>
        <li>Writing and solving single variable equations</li>
      </ol>
