            <ul>
              <li>1966 (June 13): Born in Leningrad, Soviet Union. He attended Leningrad Secondary School 239, a specialized high school with advanced math and physiscs, and Sergei Rukshin's after school math club.</li>
              <li>1982: Won a gold medal (perfect score) at the International Mathematical Olympiad.</li>
              <li>1990: Completed his PhD at Leningrad State University and began working at the Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences.</li>
              <li>1992: Invited to do research at numerous universities in the United States. Following a lecture, he meets with Richard Hamilton, who discusses Ricci flow and its possible use in proving the Poincaré Conjecture.</li>
              <li>1995: Returned to Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg.</li>
              <li>2002 - 2004: Posted three papers to arXiv, with the third paper indicating he had proved the Poincaré Conjecture.</li>
              <li>2005: Leaves his job at Steklov Institute.</li>
              <li>2006: Awarded the Fields Medal for his work on the Ricci flow, but he declined to accept the prize.</li>
              <li>2010: Awarded a Millennium Prize for solving the Poincaré Conjecture problem, which is the only Millennium Prize problem (7 total) to be solved as of 2021. Again, Perelman declined to accept the award and its $1 million prize.</li>
              <li>Perelman is living in Saint Petersburg and his mathematical endeavors are unknown. With six Millennium Prizes still unsolved, hopefully this mathematical genius is enjoying the challenge of conquering at least one.</li>

          <h3>Why did Perelman turned down the Millennium Prize and its $1 millions? It is believed he refused to accept it because the Clay Institute, which awards the prizes, did not allow the prize to be shared with Richard Hamilton.</h3>
            <h3><em>"...the main reason is my disagreement with the organized mathematical community. I don't like their decisions, I consider them unjust."</em></h3>
          <h3>The money was used to fund the Poincaré Chair at the Paris Institut Henri Poincaré.</h3>
